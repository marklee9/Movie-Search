# Movie Search Practice

This is a simple practice project that uses movie database API from https://www.themoviedb.org/.

### About this project

* The main focus of this project is to practice using external APIs and render the received JSON using React.js. 

* Keeping the code dry and readable are prioritized over styling and thus, CSS is kept to minimal.

* Spent about 4 hours.
